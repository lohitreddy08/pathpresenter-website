Geographical location information contained in the Usage Data enables us to tailor your experience on the Platforms by displaying different content based on your location, such as local advertising offers, and content in your local language. We also use Usage Data for remarketing (sometimes called retargeting) to better target ads to interested users. Retargeting uses cookies to identify users who visit a website showing a particular brand of goods or services and then targets advertisements of that brand to that user on other websites.</p>

                <h3>Anonymity of cases / images</h3>
            </div>
            <p>It is a requirement of the Terms of Use that all patient cases uploaded to any Platform by each user are de-identified such that the identity of each patient to whom the content included in the case relates (e.g. radiographic images and case notes) is not reasonably identifiable. If you become aware of any case from which you feel you (as a patient) or another person is reasonably identifiable, please contact us immediately at info@PathPresenter.com/PathPresenter.net. Information which should NOT appear on any patient cases uploaded to any Platform (based on HIPAA guidelines) includes, but is not limited to:

                    <li>name</li>
                    <li>initials</li>
                    <li>date of birth</li>
                    <li>address, including full or partial postal code</li>
                </li>telephone or fax numbers or contact information</li>
                </li>e-mail addresses</li>
                </li>unique identifying numbers (e.g. UR, MRN, HID etc..)</li>
                </li>vehicle identifiers</li>
                </li>medical device identifiers (e.g serial numbers)</li>
                </li>web or internet protocol addresses containing any link to the patient</li>
                </li>biometric data</li>
                </li>facial photograph or comparable image</li>
                </li>names of relatives</li>
                </li>date of study</li>
                    Additionally, if a case is, for one reason or another, unique in such a way that could lead to the identification of an individual from the images alone, then it should not be uploaded. This means that a case which has, for example, been featured in the media or shows particularly rare symptoms is usually inappropriate for upload. Similarly, the textual information accompanying the text should also be devoid of identifying information, and devoid of other unnecessary information which could aid in the identification of a patient.
                    
                    <span>Note</span>: Our privacy policy does not override the individual policies of institutions, and users should ensure that they are using images within their local guidelines.
                    
                    We take patient privacy very seriously, and failure to abide by these rules a breach of our privacy policy and Terms of Use. If you upload a case containing patient information, or from which a person is otherwise reasonably identifiable, your case will be deleted from the Platforms immediately upon our becoming aware of its existence and we may take such action against you as permitted under the Terms of Use.</p>

                        If you disable cookies in your web browser, delete existing cookies, or take other steps to ‘opt out’, the Platforms may not work properly and your experience with the Platforms will be less personalised and may be less enjoyable.
